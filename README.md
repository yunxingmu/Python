# Python
These are some of my python projects: 1)Project_1_xing: In this project, I performed data cleaning and transformation methods on the California house sales data and check their effects on the price prediction model. The model training and the evaluation code will be given. I tested different data pre-processing methods to obtain the best root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) on the test dataset; 2) Project_2_Xing: text data preprocessing: cleaning, transformation, and feature generation methods; 3)Project_3_Xing: classification and clustering models on text data.
